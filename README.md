# Dotfiles for my Linux Setup
## Disclaimer
This is my first time publishing my dotfiles. Therefore, if there's anything wrong, missing or that should not be here, please let me know, I'll try to name as many
of the other persons's repositories used here. If not, theire names are still in the files.
## Applications and Setup
### Neovim
I'm currently using NeoVim for taking notes during my lectures as an engineering student. I make these using LaTeX. The snippets that I use
and basically all my LaTeX related can be found in evesdropper/luasnip-latex-snippets.nvim. I believe it's really well explained I really liked
the snippets. Go check it out on his GitHub page. For the rest, it's a really simple configuration using Lazy Nvim. 
### Terminal
Just got rid of the top bar. Currently using Fish instead of Bash as I find it a lot more usesful. Also, I'm using Starship as my shell prompt with I think the Nerd Font Preset 
using Hack Nerd Font.
### LibreWolf
I highly recommend using LibreWolf (specially since the Firefox Policy thing). I think the theme used is called One Bar or Simple Bar, I can't remember but anyways, it can be found at 
https://firefoxcss-store.github.io/. 
### Fonts and Themes
For fonts, I went with FiraCode and Hack, nothing special. For the top bar for the Gnome Shell, I use a theme called Light Top Bar which is lovely and the Jasper-Dark for the applications.
